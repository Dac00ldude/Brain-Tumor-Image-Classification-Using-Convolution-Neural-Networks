## Objective
The objective of the project is to use Convusional Neural Neural Networks to classify Brain Tumors into four categories: Glioma Tumors, Meningioma Tumors, Pituitary Tumors, or No Tumors.

## Application
The reason the project is useful is because is can save lives. After diagnosing a person with a certain tumor, doctors can give the proper treatment faster without having to check manually which tumor a person has and can quickly administer aid to the patient. 

## Data Source
I got the Data from [Kaggle:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri?resource=download)

## Usage 
There are two ways to run this program: 
### Method 1: Jupyter Notebook
download the ipynb file
run using notebook of choice
### Method 2: Running through terminal
Make sure to download the .py file, NOT the ipynb file
go to command prompt and type the path to the installed .py file in the propmt
#### to install openCV and Keras, type the two commands below:
For openCV: type pip install opencv-pyhton
For Keras: type pip install keras
For TensorFlow: type pip install tensorflow *(this one will take a few minutes)*
