## Objective
The objective of the project is to use Convusional Neural Neural Networks to classify Brain Tumors into four categories: Glioma Tumors, Meningioma Tumors, Pituitary Tumors, or No Tumors.

## Application
The reason the project is useful is because is can save lives. After diagnosing a person with a certain tumor, doctors can give the proper treatment faster without having to check manually ehci tumor a person has and can quickly administer aid to the patient. 

## Usage 
There are two ways to run this program: 
### Method 1: Jupyter Notebook
### Method 2: Running through terminal
go to command prompt and type python with no capital letters
